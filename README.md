Your friend Ethan dolan was very impressed with the invitations that you created for grayson dolans graduation party.  suggests that the two of you start an invitation printing business together. He wants you to create a program that prompts customers for the following party details...

* guest_name
* party_name
* date
* time
* host_name

...and then prints out custom invitations that look something like this:

```
